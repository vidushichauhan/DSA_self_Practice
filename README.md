# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This project is a personal learning endeavor to deepen my understanding of fundamental and advanced DSA concepts. Here, I will be documenting my progress, sharing code, and providing explanations on various topics within the domain.

## Contents that I will add

- **Introduction to DSA**: Basic concepts of data structures and algorithms.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Operations and problems related to linear data structures.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists examples and exercises.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation and problem-solving using LIFO and FIFO structures.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Binary trees, AVL trees, graph algorithms, and more.
- **Sorting and Searching**: Various algorithms with their complexities.
- **Advanced Topics**: Hashing, dynamic programming, and other advanced algorithms.

## Getting Started

This repository is structured by topic. Each folder contains source code, a README with explanations, and additional resources like links to further readings or problem sets.

### Prerequisites

No specific prerequisites are needed to explore this repository, but familiarity with a programming language (examples here are in Java, Python, etc.) and basic programming concepts is recommended.
